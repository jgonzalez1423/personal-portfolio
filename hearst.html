    <h1>Hearst Castle Campaign</h1>

    <p>
      As part of a Contect Creation class branding project for Hearst Castle, I created two promotional Canva graphics designed to highlight its historic beauty and appeal to creative, curious travelers. The tone aimed to feel timeless, serene, and elegant — in line with our strategic brand messaging.

      These ads were targeted at adults aged 30–65, including professionals, educators, and retirees — people who value architecture, history, and culture. The goal was to increase spring/fall visitation by emphasizing peaceful evening tours and scenic beauty.
